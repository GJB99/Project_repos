# OptimalModels_Research
This is the hub to store the data, processing code (.py) and results for my independent research in finding optimal models across diverse financial time series datasets.

For each asset (there are 30, 10 of each ETFs, stocks and cryptocurrencies) there is given: 
- Returns vs VaR of last two years for the top 3 models of that asset.
- The console output of the Code.py for each asset. This includes all the tables for performance metrics and assumption checks.
- A graph of the price for the asset. This is over the whole dataset its timespan.
- A graph of the returns for the asset. This is over the whole dataset its timespan.
